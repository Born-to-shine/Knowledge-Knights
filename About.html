<p class="thought">
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; The website Knowledge Knights provides the users to learn the basic programs which are very useful to build the solution for real world
program. It even provides other sorts of questions like Aptitude and the puzzles which are likely to be asked in the interview. <br/>
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; The credit for creating this website goes to my Lord Shri Krishna and my Parents and my Sister who encouraged me all the times to
do something new. Hope that all the users get more benefit from the website and crack the interviews as my sister and me gonna do....<br/>
